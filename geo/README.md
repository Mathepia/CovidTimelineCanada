# Geographic data

## Health regions

Health region names and unique identifiers (UIDs) were derived from the [2018 cartographic boundary files for health regions](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-402-x/2018001/hrbf-flrs-eng.htm) provided by Statistics Canada. The following changes were made to reflect updates to health region bounaries and to match the geography used by the province/territory to report COVID-19 data:

* Renamed Oxford Elgin St. Thomas Health Unit / Circonscription sanitaire d’Oxford, Elgin et St. Thomas (3575) to Southwestern Public Health Unit / Circonscription sanitaire du Sud-Ouest (3575)
* Removed Huron County Health Unit / Circonscription sanitaire du comté de Huron (3539) and Perth District Health Unit / Circonscription sanitaire du district de Perth (3554) and replaced with Huron Perth Public Health Unit / Circonscription sanitaire de Huron et Perth (3539)
* Replaced British Columbia's 16 Health Service Delivery Areas (5911, 5912, 5913, 5914, 5921, 5922, 5923, 5931, 5932, 5933, 5941, 5942, 5943, 5951, 5952, 5953) with the five amalgamated Regional Health Authorities (591, 592, 593, 594, 595)
* Replaced Saskatchewan's 13 zones (4701, 4702, 4703, 4704, 4705, 4706, 4707, 4708, 4709, 4710, 4711, 4712, 4713) with the 13 new health regions (4711, 4712, 4713, 4721, 4722, 4723, 4731, 4732, 4741, 4751, 4761, 4762, 4763); note that these UIDs were created by appending a fourth, incrementing digit to the end of the previous 6 amalgamated zones (471, 472, 473, 474, 475, 476)
