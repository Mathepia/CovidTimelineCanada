Deaths: settled on 1, the monthly number of deaths reported, since none of the deaths reported in the weekly reports from April were from the current reporting period, all were from the previous reporting period. Considered 383 (cumulative sum since 2022-07-01 in May report) - 374 (cumulative sum since 2022-07-01 in April report) - 13 (newly reported deaths between the 2023-05-08 and 2023-05-22 reports), but this results in a negative number. 383 (cumulative sum since 2022-07-01 in May report) - 424 (daily sum since 2022-07-01 from time series) also results in a negative number, presumably due to internal backdating of deaths.
